2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk10mhz_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk10mhz_IBUF_inst/O
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-10#1 Warning
Missing property on synchronizer

TIMING-38#1 Warning
Bus skew constraint applied on multiple clocks  
Multiple clocks involved on source or destination of a bus skew constraint (see constraint position 32 in the Timing Constraint Window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to have only one source clock and one destination clock per bus skew constraint
Related violations: <none>

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hierarchical -filter {NAME =~*QSPI_CORE_INTERFACE_I/FIFO_EXISTS.CLK_CROSS_I/LOGIC_GENERATION_CDC.SPISEL_PULSE_S2AX_1_CDC/D}]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '19' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].

XDCB-5#2 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -hierarchical -filter {NAME =~*RESET_SYNC_AXI_SPI_CLK_INST/RESET_SYNC_AX2S_1/D}]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '18' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency).

The option '-to : [get_pins -hierarchical -filter {NAME =~*_FIFO_II/USE_2N_DEPTH.V6_S6_AND_LATER.I_ASYNC_FIFO_BRAM/*rstblk*/*PRE}]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '21' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency).

XDCC-1#1 Warning
Scoped Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous scoped clock constraint with the same name. It is not recommended to override a scoped (typically an IP) clock constraint and could result in unexpected behaviors.
New: create_clock -period 100.000 -name clk10mhz -waveform {0.000 50.000} -add [get_ports clk10mhz] (Source: C:/Users/fmabrouk/Documents/FPGA/MicroBlaze_2017/VHDL/Constraints.xdc (Line: 3))
